These are examples highlighting some differences between ABL and other languages such as C#, Python, and Java when they query a database. We're using a mySQL database that is a mirror of the sports2000 database (which will be uploaded in June).

Currently, the Structures folder still uses a sample mySQL database called 'classicmodels', which can be found here: http://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx. 

All of these files should be runnable with minimal effort. For any questions, email aestrada @ progress dot com.
